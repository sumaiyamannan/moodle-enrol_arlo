      | Activity one  | true           | true         | Draft           |

    And I navigate to the manage perform activities page

    #Add multiple elements
    And I click on "Activity one" "link"
    And I navigate to manage perform activity content page
    And I add a "Multiple choice: multi-select" activity content element
    And I set the following fields to these values:
