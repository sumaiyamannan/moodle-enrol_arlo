Feature: Short text element supports multi-lang filters in titles

  Background:
    Given I am on a totara site
    And I log in as "admin"
    Given the following "activities" exist in "mod_perform" plugin:
      | activity_name        | create_section | create_track | activity_status |
      | Add Element Activity | true           | true         | Draft           |
    # Enabling multi-language filters for headings and content.
    And the multi-language content filter is enabled

  Scenario: Set multi-lang text as question title for short text element type and make sure it's displayed correctly
    Given I navigate to the manage perform activities page
    And I click on "Add Element Activity" "link"

    # Adding a new item
    And I click on "Edit content elements" "button"
    And I click on "Add element" "button"
    And I click on "Short text" "button"
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | rawTitle | <span lang="en" class="multilang">it's an English question</span><span lang="de" class="multilang">deutsche Frage</span> |
    # Currently a changed text won't be filtered until saved
    And I click on "Done" "button" in the ".tui-performEditSectionContentModal__form" "css_element"
    And I close the tui notification toast
    Then I should see "it's an English question"
    When I click on edit icon for question "it's an English question"
    Then the following fields match these values:
      | rawTitle | <span lang="en" class="multilang">it's an English question</span><span lang="de" class="multilang">deutsche Frage</span> |
    When I click on "Cancel" "button" in the ".tui-performEditSectionContentModal__form" "css_element"
    And I close the tui modal
    And I click on "Edit content elements" "button"

    And I should see "it's an English question"
