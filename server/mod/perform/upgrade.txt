* activity_setting::create() function no longer checks if the current user has permission to manage the activity. The
  check should be performed before calling this function, where applicable.
* Deprecated the following methods:
    * track_user_assigned_bulk::create_from_user_assignments(); use
      track_user_assigned_bulk::create_from_track_assignment instead.
* Notification settings are no longer lazy-loaded, and instead notification records are created upon the creation of
  the activity itself. There is now no longer a distinction between 'real' and 'sparse' notifications.
  The following have been deprecated as part of this change:

  * \mod_perform\models\activity\details\notification_sparse - notifications are no longer lazy loaded, please use
    \mod_perform\models\activity\notification instead.
  * \mod_perform\models\activity\details\notification_real - all functionality has been moved into
    \mod_perform\models\activity\notification so use that instead.
  * \mod_perform\models\activity\details\notification_interface - interface is no longer necessary
