Feature: Theme settings basic validations for tenants
  Theme settings should work as expected
  As a user
  I need to confirm that I can navigate to theme settings and see all the different elements

  Background:
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And I am on a totara site
    And tenant support is enabled with full tenant isolation
    And the following "tenants" exist:
      | name          | idnumber |
      | First Tenant  | ten1     |
      | Second Tenant | ten2     |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | tenantmember | tenantparticipant |
      | user1    | name1     | surname1 | ten1         |                   |
      | user2    | name2     | surname2 | ten2         |                   |

    And I navigate to "Ventura" node in "Site administration > Appearance > Themes"

  Scenario: Confirm we see the tenant selection page

    Then I should see the tui datatable contains:
      | Tenant        | Tenant identifier | Branding |
